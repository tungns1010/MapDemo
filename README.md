Map Demo
=================

An example of how to use the MapKit framework, displaying a map view with a
custom MKAnnotations. This relates to the [iOS Maps](/guides/ios/platform_features/ios_maps/) guide in the developer centre.

It also contains the completed sample created at the end of the iOS [Walkthrough â€“ Exploring annotations and overlays in MapKit](/guides/ios/platform_features/ios_maps_walkthrough/).
